Test tensor notes

dimensions: 20,000 x 20,000 x 20,000

Tests on 3 mode tensors

Q.Does the hash favor flipping certain bits?

test1: fix all but mode 0- 0.99 sparsity
test2: fix all but mode 1- 0.99 sparsity
test3: fix all but mode 2- 0.99 sparsity

A. No. Each test resulted in the exact same collision rate, avg probe depth,
and every other statistic we measured.

Q. What happens if a mode is duplicated onto another mode?
testb1: fix all but mode 0, copy all entries to mode 1. 0.99 sparsity- fixed indices at 1


Q. What happens if a mode is duplicated onto another mode then perturbed slightly?
testc1: same as testb1, but duplicated indices are perturbed by 100 (no change)
testc2: same as testc1, but dims[50,000 50,000 50,000] (resulted in slight lowering of collisison rate)
testc3: same as testc1, but dims[50,000 50,000 50,000 50,000] (resulted in very bad collision rate, avg probe depth)
